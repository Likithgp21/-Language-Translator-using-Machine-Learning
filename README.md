🌍 Language Translator using Machine Learning
🧠 Overview

This project builds a Language Translator App that translates English text into French using a many-to-many encoder-decoder model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The model is trained on an English-French dataset, enabling it to learn input (English) sequences and generate corresponding French translations.

🚀 Features

Translates English sentences into French.

Uses a sequence-to-sequence LSTM model.

Learns contextual relationships between words.

Can be extended for other language pairs.
